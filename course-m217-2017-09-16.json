One such option is cooperative education, which provides a student with an extended work experience with a company or government institution.    To participate, students must possess at least junior status and have an overall grade point average of 3.0 or above.  Students must complete a Co-Op Approval Form and submit it for approval.  If the application is approved, the course will be added to the students schedule and the student will be assessed tuition for 0 units for each semester that the student participates. All co-ops must be approximately 5-8 months in uninterrupted length. Upon completion of the co-op experience, students must submit a 1-2 page report of their work experience, and a 1-2 page evaluation from the company supervisor to the ME Undergraduate Education Committee.  If the reports are approved, a P grade will be assigned.  International students should contact their academic advisor for additional information.   Prerequisite:  Special permission required",

The objectives of this course are to help  students develop a critical approach to the evaluation of study  designs, data and results, and to develop skills in the application of  basic statistical methods in empirical research.  An important feature  of the course will be the use of the computer to facilitate the  understanding of important statistical ideas and for the  implementation of data analysis. In addition to three lectures a week,  students will attend a computer lab once a week. Examples will be  drawn from areas of applications of particular interest to HSS  students. Not open to students who have received credit for  36-207/70-207, 36-220, 36-225, 36-625, or 36-247.",

One such option is an internship, normally completed during the summer. Students do not need to officially register for an internship unless they want it listed on their official transcripts. CIT students interested in registering their internship for course credit on their transcript may enroll in this course. To do so, students must complete a CIT Internship form (located in Scaife Hall 110) and submit for approval. The CIT Undergraduate Studies Office will add the course to the students schedule, and the student will be assessed tuition for 3 units. Upon completion of the internship, students must submit a 1-2 page report of their work experience, and a 1-2 page evaluation from the company supervisor to the CIT Undergraduate Office. After the reports has been reviewed and approved, a P grade will be assigned. This process should be used by international students interested in Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or by any other engineering undergraduate wishing to have their internship experience reflected on their official University transcript. International students should also be authorized by the Office of International Education (OIE). More information regarding CPT is available on OIEs website.",

      "desc": "76-101 introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

These will include: moral problems (Ethics), problems rising from the debates about free-will, personal identity or intelligence (Metaphysics), and inquiries about the scope and limits of human knowledge (Epistemology). We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments. These skills include: how to present a philosophic argument, what are the assumptions that justify it, what are its weaknesses and its strengths, whether such weaknesses can be resolved and, if they cannot be resolved, why.",

An answer to this question requires: (i) uncovering the logical form of statements; (ii) defining the correctness of logical steps; (iii) formulating inference rules for the logical forms; (iv) designing strategies for argumentation with the inference rules. The course takes these steps for both sentential and quantificational logic. Presentation: The material is presented on-line, though some exercises must be done with pen and paper. Additional reading of historical and philosophical character complements the systematic on-line presentation. Weekly small discussion meetings with collaborative reviews, substantive discussions and critical reflections supplement the on-line material.",
