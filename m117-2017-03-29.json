As they proceed with their projects, they will be mentored to enhance their skills in data interpretation and oral and written communication through discussions, weekly oral presentations of research progress, preparation of two written research reports and a final presentation. SRI students participate in team projects linked to the research programs of MCS faculty. Projects generally involve multidisciplinary approaches involving molecular biology, chemistry, biochemistry, bioinformatics and structural, cellular, or developmental biology. All students receive training in a common set of essential laboratory methods in molecular biology and biochemistry before initiating their specific team projects.",

      "desc": "An introduction to programming based on a functional model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

This time involves deployment - the period between the completion of the code by the developers and the placing of the code into normal production  and dealing with operations issues. Deployment time can be days, weeks, or even months when using normal development practices. Operational issues such as dealing with incidents and errors introduce other delays.  Modern internet companies deploy a system multiple or even dozens of times every day. Achieving this velocity requires coordinated process and design activities together with supporting tooling. This course will cover the deployment process and the associated tooling, it will highlight reasons why release schedules can be slow, and it will introduce the practices that are used to enable high velocity deployments. It will also cover the kinds of problems that are created because of high velocity and how modern internet companies deal with these problems.",

Its purpose is to enable software engineers to be more effective in domains where software and hardware are closely coupled. Examples of such domains include robotics, avionics, automotive, process control, and many others. Students successfully completing this course will be better prepared to communicate with hardware-oriented engineers, understand the hardware environment, and the subtle regions where software and hardware meet.   Requirement: Students need not have a hardware background, but they should have a solid computer science background including languages, data structures, discrete math, operating systems, and computer organization.  It is highly desirable that students have project experience, preferably real-world experience, although project course work and/or internships will suffice. Undergraduates need instructor approval (lattanze@cs.cmu.edu).",

      "desc": "Internet services companies such as Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook have pioneered systems that have achieved unprecedented scale while still providing high level availability and a high cost-performance.  These systems differ from mainstream high performance systems in fundamental ways.  They are data intensive rather than compute intensive as we see with mainstream super computers spending the bulk of their time performing data I/O and manipulation rather than computation.  They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high reliability and availability demands as well.  Given that they often operate in the commercial space the cost-performance of these systems needs to be such that the organizations dependent on such systems can turn a profit. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover the set of topics needed in order to design and build data intensive scalable systems.  In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance.   Given the large distributed nature of these systems basic distributed systems concepts such as consistency and time and synchronization are also important.  These systems largely operate around the clock, placing an emphasis on operational concerns.  This course will introduce students to these concerns with the intent that they understand the extent to which things like deploying, monitoring, and upgrading impact the design. The course will be a hands-on project oriented course.  The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project.  The students will gain exposure to the core concepts needed to design and build such systems as well as current technologies in this space.  Class size will be limited.",

All the people on the team must have completed the core courses in the MSIT Program prior to beginning the Project.  The Project can be completed on or off campus.  Summary of steps for a Project: .  Propose a project using the defined formal format provided.  In the proposal you will provide:  (1) An Executive summary (2) Definition of the work to be completed, which will include:  (a) Deliverables   (b) Time lines  (c) Two Reviews (mid point presentation and Final presentation)  (d) Final report .  Discuss the project with a designated faculty mentor .  Discuss the project with a technical mentor (Certain requirements must be met by your technical advisor, speak to your mentor) .  Get your proposal signed off (The CMU director faculty mentor and your technical mentor will approve your Project proposal.) .  Begin the project, reporting periodically to the faculty mentor and workplace mentor.  Another form of project is to subcontract with a MSE team to provide deliverables.  This option would be primarily available to on campus MSIT students.  The project will be an independent part of the MSE project which must be deliverable if the MSE project fails.

One such option is an internship, normally completed during the summer. If a student receives an internship, the Mechanical Engineering Department will add the internship course to the students schedule, and the student will be assessed tuition for 3 units. Upon completion of the internship, students must submit a 2-3 page report with supervisor signature detailing the work experience and including how the internship was related to Mechanical Engineering. After the report has been reviewed and approved, a letter grade will be assigned and these 3 units will count towards degree requirements. International students interested in registering for the practicum must also be authorized for Curricular Practical Training (CPT).

The objectives of this course are to help  students develop a critical approach to the evaluation of study  designs, data and results, and to develop skills in the application of  basic statistical methods in empirical research.  An important feature  of the course will be the use of the computer to facilitate the  understanding of important statistical ideas and for the  implementation of data analysis. In addition to three lectures a week,  students will attend a computer lab once a week. Examples will be  drawn from areas of applications of particular interest to HSS  students.

Students must possess at least junior status and have an overall grade point average of 3.0 or above. All co-ops must be approximately 8 months in uninterrupted length. If the co-op is approved, the CIT Undergraduate Studies Office will add the course to the students schedule, and the student will be assessed tuition for 0-3 units. Upon completion of the co-op experience, students must submit a 1-2 page report of their work experience, and a 1-2 page evaluation from the company supervisor to the CIT Undergraduate Office. If the reports are approved, a P grade will be assigned. International students should also be authorized by the Office ofInternational Education (OIE).

One such option is an internship, normally completed during the summer. Students do not need to officially register for an internship unless they want it listed on their official transcripts. CIT students interested in registering their internship for course credit on their transcript may enroll in this course. To do so, students must complete a CIT Internship form (located in Scaife Hall 110) and submit for approval. The CIT Undergraduate Studies Office will add the course to the students schedule, and the student will be assessed tuition for 3 units. Upon completion of the internship, students must submit a 1-2 page report of their work experience, and a 1-2 page evaluation from the company supervisor to the CIT Undergraduate Office. After the reports has been reviewed and approved, a P grade will be assigned. This process should be used by international students interested in Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or by any other engineering undergraduate wishing to have their internship experience reflected on their official University transcript. International students should also be authorized by the Office of International Education (OIE). More information regarding CPT is available on OIEs website.",

The examination comprises written and/or oral parts. The student will be considered to have passed the qualifying examination when he or she has successfully completed all of the required parts. A candidate must take the qualifying examination at the time specified by the department, generally within the first three semesters of study. Upon satisfactorily passing the examination, the student will be accepted as a candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. If the student has not already received a Masters Degree, upon application and provided that all other requirements have been met, he or she may be granted the degree of Master of Science at the next commencement.    Passing the Ph.D. qualifying examination admits a student to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree for a period of no longer than six calendar years. If, at the end of this six-year period, the Ph.D. has not been awarded, the student must reapply for admission to the graduate program and will be judged competitively with other students applying at the same time. If the student is re-admitted, he or she may, at the discretion of the department, be requested to pass the qualifying examination again before the Ph.D. is awarded. A student may petition for extension of the six-year limit under extenuating circumstances such as a forced change of advisor, military service, or prolonged illness. Note that the time limits on the duration of Ph.D. candidacy outlined here are more restrictive than those of the general university policy.",

For non-ETC students   The Entertainment Technology Center offers independent study opportunities to non-ETC students on a very limited basis. Registering for the independent study allows students, in essence, to work be a part of ETC project course in which ETC students are in small, interdisciplinary teams, creating artifacts under direct faculty supervision. The number of projects per semester will vary. The primary objective of the courses is to provide a hands-on working experience with teammates who are from different backgrounds and disciplines. Other objectives are to experience project management, and have the possibility of working with an external client (some projects have external collaborators). The requirements for a project are that: the team contain students from both technology and non-technology backgrounds, the team must prototype and produce a tangible artifact (not a paper), and the work must be supervised by a faculty member approved by the ETC for this project.  Registration to the course requires a completed independent study work outline.  See the ETC Director of Student Services for the form.",

      "desc": "Alexander Technique was developed by FM Alexander, a Shakespearean actor, to address his ongoing vocal hoarseness. He investigated how the manner in we think affects how we speak, move and perform activities in our lives. He looked for ways to apply the principles of the Alexander Technique to develop more ease in daily activities and more freedom of expression in artistic activities. He termed this approach psycho-physical re-education. The Alexander Technique provides individuals with tools, including gentle hands on guidance by the teacher, to address specific habits of tension that may be impeding effectiveness. The technique is particularly valuable for performers such as actors, singers and musicians as well as visual artists. The course is also useful for those in business, medicine, law or any field where she  or he has to present ideas to groups. This course will introduce basic principles of the Alexander Technique and guide students in approaches to apply these principles to fine arts such as acting, playing a musical instrument, drawing, dancing as well as day to day activities such as working at a desk with a computer, public speaking, working out, etc. Participants should wear loose fitting clothing for each movement such as sweat pants and tee shirts, no jeans, ties or belts please.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

This class will explore the historical and contemporary significations of gender and sexuality in relation to the institutions that govern and define them. As we investigate the material consequences of different epistemes of gender as natural, embodied, philosophical, psychological, physiological, performative, and/or compulsory, this course will probe you to think about how power and inequality have structurally impacted categories of gender and sexuality.  This class will also investigate gender as it intersects with other forms of identity, such as race, class, ability, and geography. We will read feminist and gender theorists, womens rights activists, queer and transgender theorists, fiction, poetry, and blogs to construct a wide-ranging historico-cultural understanding of gender as a social and material category. Through class discussions, reflection posts, presentations, three short papers and one final paper, students will read, think, discuss, present, and write on gender in history, gender and economy, gender and the law, and gender and the self. At the end of the course, you should be able to understand and articulate certain principles of gender as socially and culturally constructed while also exploring its cultural gaps, local meanings, and personal significance of gender and sexuality in cultural politics and everyday living.",

The United States also made great strides in expanding political and civil rights for workers, women, African-Americans, and gays and lesbians. This course explores the cultural implications of these developments on the generations of American people who came of age in the twentieth century. It assesses both the triumphs and tribulations of twentieth-century life. We will analyze the continuities, contradictions, and conflicts in American history, especially in regard to the nations dueling political ideologies: conservatism and liberalism. Special attention will be given to the evolving relationship among the state, the corporate sector, and ordinary people. Topics include: the Progressive Era, the Great Depression, World War II, the Cold War, Civil Rights, Vietnam, and the New Conservatism.",

We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments. These skills include: how to present a philosophic argument, what are the assumptions that justify it, what are its weaknesses and its strengths, whether such weaknesses can be resolved and, if they cannot be resolved, why.",

These historical moments cast light on the philosophy behind the development of the US constitution. Following Ketcham, well discuss the debate between the ancients and moderns, enlightenment ideas regarding liberty and equality as well as the distinction between private rights and public goods.  After presenting some fundamental justifications for democracy and our current models of democratic governance, well study the basic political frameworks of our day through a thorough-going analytic analysis of the writings and arguments of recent and contemporary political philosophers such as John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, Robert Nozick, Charles Talyor, Michael Sandel, and Annette Baier. The course will end with a discussion of the theory and practice of deliberative democracy and a chance for students to engage in this model of democracy through the activities of an ersatz deliberative poll.",

In this course, we will investigate the means by which a successful argument justifies its conclusion, as well as various subtle ways in which other arguments fail. In the course of our inquiry, we will take a historically informed approach to studying logic and argumentative fallacies. We will also discover that these tools are useful for constructing and analyzing arguments in all disciplines from philosophy and history to psychology and physics. Our primary goal is to learn to use these tools to make our thinking and writing clearer, more precise, and more critical. To that end, our coursework will consist in homework and exams on topics in logic, as well as essays on a wide variety of topics. This course is intended for students from any discipline who would like to improve their writing and critical thinking skills.",

What kind of cultural exchanges took place between modern Japan and the West? How are Japans traditional values transformed in the face of modern technicalization and industrialization, compared to the modernization of other countries? And, in turn, what kind of impact has modern Japanese culture had on todays world? Tackling these questions among others, the course also extends to such issues as the legacy of traditional Japanese culture, the modern Emperor system, World War II experiences, emerging voices of minorities, and popular culture (e.g., anime and subculture).

In this course, we will explore a variety of questions, advantages, and challenges related to language diversity and cultural identity across the globe. Our main focus will be on contexts of multilingualismthat is, contexts in which two or more languages may be used. Adopting a comparative case study approach, we will explore the following themes: (i) The historical underpinnings of language diversity and its consequences for cultural identity today (e.g., migration, colonization, conquest); (ii) How language diversity and cultural identity shapes, and is shaped by, local, regional, national, and international politics; (iii) The relationship between language diversity and language use and visibility in public spaces (i.e., the linguistic landscape); (iv) Relations between linguistic communities (e.g., majority and minority language users) and the sense of belonging to a culture.   The course is taught in English. Students who wish to take the course as a Modern Languages major or minor elective will need to complete their final project on a topic relevant to the language they study.",

Prerequisite: None  FALL 2015: Baba Yaga, Koschei the Immortal, the Firebird, Ivan the Tsarevich:  Russian fairy tales brim over with monsters and magic, witches and devils, heroes and villains, princes and queens. In this course we examine a wide selection of these tales for what they can reveal about Russian cultures ethics, aesthetics, values and habits of mind. Students discover these through four analytical approaches: structural, psychological, feminist and socio-political. Attention is paid to the ways in which fairy tales hold sway in literature and the fine arts from centuries past right through to the present day. Course requirements include primary and secondary readings, oral presentations, written essays, tests and participation in class discussions.

Tenure track, teaching track, research track, librarian track, and special faculty may serve as SURA mentors. The subject of the inquiry, the number of units, and the criteria for grading are to be determined by the student and the faculty mentor. This agreement should be formalized in a one-page apprenticeship verification form that includes documented approval from the faculty mentor with a copy to be submitted to the Undergraduate Research Office (URO). In addition to the research experience, course requirements include an individual meeting with the students career counselor at the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) to update the students resume, an individual meeting with a tutor at the Global Communication Center (GCC) to begin to develop a professional biography, and presentation at Meeting of the Minds undergraduate research symposium during the subsequent spring semester. Students may register for a maximum of nine units with work to be completed over an eight-week period during the summer all term.",
