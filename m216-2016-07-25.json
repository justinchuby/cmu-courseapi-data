We will begin with a clinical focus on neuroanatomy, introducing students to some basic neurological diagnostic techniques. We will then explore the biological basis of neuronal function and link the function of individual neurons to a broader context of neural systems.  This will be done in the context of primary literature.  Students who complete this course will therefore have an understanding of research methods and be prepared to evaluate scientific literature.  The course will have a strong focus on the biological and cellular basis of neuronal excitability and also give students significant, in depth exposure to the function of synapses and their plasticity.  Finally, the course will give students an in depth look at sensory and/or motor systems by focusing on one system in particular, rather than providing a broad overview of many different sensory and motor systems.",

Once the form has been submitted and   approved by the faculty member the student is conducting the research   with, the ECE Undergraduate Office will add the course to the students   schedule.  Typical credit is granted as one hour of research per week is   equal to one unit of credit.",

The major topics  to be covered include methods for exploratory data analysis, an  introduction to research methods, elementary probability, and methods  for statistical inference.  The objectives of this course are to help  students develop a critical approach to the evaluation of study  designs, data and results, and to develop skills in the application of  basic statistical methods in empirical research.  An important feature  of the course will be the use of the computer to facilitate the  understanding of important statistical ideas and for the  implementation of data analysis. In addition to three lectures a week,  students will attend a computer lab once a week. Examples will be  drawn from areas of applications of particular interest to HSS  students. Not open to students who have received credit for  36-207/70-207, 36-220, 36-225, 36-625, or 36-247.",

One such option is an internship, normally completed during the summer. Students do not need to officially register for an internship unless they want it listed on their official transcripts. CIT students interested in registering their internship for course credit on their transcript may enroll in this course. To do so, students must complete a CIT Internship form (located in Scaife Hall 110) and submit for approval. The CIT Undergraduate Studies Office will add the course to the students schedule, and the student will be assessed tuition for 3 units. Upon completion of the internship, students must submit a 1-2 page report of their work experience, and a 1-2 page evaluation from the company supervisor to the CIT Undergraduate Office. After the reports has been reviewed and approved, a P grade will be assigned. This process should be used by international students interested in Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or by any other engineering undergraduate wishing to have their internship experience reflected on their official University transcript. International students should also be authorized by the Office of International Education (OIE). More information regarding CPT is available on OIEs website.",

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

The basic idea of the course is to give you experience in developing the writing skills you will be expected to have as you make the transition from student to professional. The course will cover resume writing, proposal writing, writing instructions, the difference between writing for general and specific audiences, and analysis of visual aids in various texts. The course requires that students work both independently and in groups.",

You are responsible for finding an internship. Most of your class time for the course will be completed at your internship site - a minimum of 120 hours (8-10 per week) over the semester for 9 units of credit. As the academic component of the course, youll keep a reflective journal and meet periodically with the internship coordinator to discuss your internship and related professional issues. You must register for the course before the add/drop deadline of the semester in which you want to do your internship. Before you can register, you must contact the internship instructor listed above to express your interest in the course and to be cleared for registration. Credit for the internship course cannot be retroactively awarded for past internships.",

These will include: moral problems (Ethics), problems rising from the debates about free-will, personal identity or intelligence (Metaphysics), and inquiries about the scope and limits of human knowledge (Epistemology). We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments. These skills include: how to present a philosophic argument, what are the assumptions that justify it, what are its weaknesses and its strengths, whether such weaknesses can be resolved and, if they cannot be resolved, why.",

The course introduces learners to basic concepts and information to facilitate entry and engagement in an Arabic-speaking environment. The Arabic for Global Exchange project aims to meet a need for high quality, communication-oriented instructional materials to introduce basic cultural knowledge and survival language. Arabic for Global Exchange is a six-week, six-lesson, half-semester course (equivalent of six weeks of university-level instruction), or roughly sixty hours of student effort. Each of the six lessons in the course includes texts and activities to promote acquisition of cultural content in English as well as basic introductory exposure to the Arabic language.
